Issue Summary:
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM on May 8th, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: Our web application experienced a 100% downtime during the outage period, affecting all users accessing the platform. Users were unable to log in, access any features, or retrieve data.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database server failure due to a disk space exhaustion.
Timeline:
9:55 AM: Issue detected as monitoring alerts flagged database response time degradation.
10:00 AM: Engineers began investigating potential causes, initially focusing on network connectivity and server load.
10:30 AM: Misleading assumption made that the issue could be related to recent code deployment.
11:00 AM: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
12:00 PM: Root cause identified as database server disk space exhaustion.
12:30 PM: Database server disk space manually freed up to restore service.
2:00 PM: Service fully restored, and database performance stabilized.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The database server's disk space became fully utilized due to excessive log files and temporary data storage, leading to failure in write operations.
Resolution: Database server disk space manually freed up by deleting unnecessary log files and temporary data, allowing write operations to resume and service restoration.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements: Implement automated monitoring for disk space utilization on all critical servers. Enhance logging practices to prevent unnecessary data accumulation.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement automated disk space monitoring using tools like Nagios or Prometheus.
Review and optimize logging configurations to prevent excessive log file generation.
Schedule regular database maintenance tasks to purge temporary data and optimize storage usage.
Conduct a post-mortem meeting to analyze the outage response and identify further areas for improvement in incident management procedures.
By implementing these measures, we aim to proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact service availability, ensuring a more resilient and reliable web application for our users.
